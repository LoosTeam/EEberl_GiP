# Tables comparing nutritional status in first or second trimester between initiated and not-initated GiP groups
## First trimester nutritional status

This code filters the data for participants in the subset used for the logistic regression change analysis (Change_IDs) and creates a summary table comparing nutritional status parameters in the first trimester between participants who did anddid not intiate geophagia in the third trimester. The table includes statistics, p-values, and confidence intervals:

## Second trimester nutritional status 

This code filters the data for participants in the subset used for the logistic regression change analysis (Change_IDs) and creates a summary table comparing mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and haemoglobin in the secondtrimester between participants who did and did not intiate geophagia in the third trimester. The table includes statistics, p-values, and confidence intervals:
